Oh git!
you may confuse me now,
but later you will make me less confused,

I think

Great

I think I will be alright like everytime
So Git you better be kind!
And Please WORK!

I think...

I will forget the password every other day and
gotta reset!
Adding more

It was great, Thank you!

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

I will be happy to collaborate with classmates

I will not be changing my major to computer science

My skills in programming are being tested
If only I were more awake and well rested
Then this beginning file would not have me bested

I prefer R,
But python will help me go far

That I am going to need a nap after using git.

I fear that I will run out of time
I'm typing so I don't get left behind

every hill I climb
I find two more on the other side.

Any present suffering,
will just mean a future ease!

Just checking fr today, if I can still do this! 


Co-coding a poem would be so fun,
But if it fails I will impress no one.

When I look at a blank sheet
and think about git
my mind becomes a blank
and I need to git merge with my
upstream thoughts

One two three four five
Follow the steps
of the GIT cookbook
and make your fussy cake
